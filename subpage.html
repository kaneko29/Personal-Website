				<h3> Importance </h3>
		<p> Traffic has been an increasing problem as the global population rises and more people move into cities. This has led to vehicles slowing down during times of high congestion, which directly results in fuel emissions. Fuel emissions and greenhouse gases are harmful for the environment and cause global warming. Luckily, the future of transportation is in self-driving electric vehicles, which do not emit fuel during driving. However, they still consume electricity, which is produced in factories which still emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Therefore, reducing the energy consumption in electric vehicles is important for the environment, which is what this model aims to do.</p>
